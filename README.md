Creating a Rule based chatbots 

Chatbots react to questions or statements that match their database with appropriate answers or action.

Depending on the context a chatbot is used in, it can be enhanced by Nditional acces to external data such as customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

Negative responses ("no", "nope", "nah", "naw", "not a chance", "sorry")


Some random questions
("Why are you here?", "Are there many humans like you? "Does Earth have a leader?",

"What do you consume for sustenance? "Is there intelligent life on this planet?",

"What planets have you visited?", "What technology do you have on this planet?")


Consider this bot as an alien
